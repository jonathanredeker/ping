## 📝&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To-do
- [x] Add precise collisions for paddles, ball and bounds
- [ ] Removed all of those pesky global variables
- [ ] Add ability to hide sprites when changing game states (scenes)
- [ ] Add a scoreboard
- [ ] Create the scenes: menu, pause, win and lose.
- [ ] Implement an AI that doesn't just mirror the ball's y-coordinate. (lol)
